# TYPES OF PORTFOLIO PROFILES

High risk (aggressive): A high risk profile refers to an investment approach or a portfolio strategy  that is willing to take on higher levels of risk in exchange for the potential of higher returns. Portfolio risk=0.3

Moderate risk: A moderate risk profile is a team used to describe an individual or organizationâ€™s attitude toward risks. portfolio risk =0.23-0.25

Low risk (conservative): A conservative portfolio prioritizes capital preservation and stability over high returns. It primarily consists of  low-risk assets like bonds, money market instruments, and cash. Investors with a conservative profile have a low risk tolerance and aim to protect the capital. Portfolio risk=0.19

# ANALYZING ON BASIS OF WEIGHTS

According to data ITC is the most stable stock. And  as it can be seen that ITC has highest percentage in minimum risk profile and the percentage decreases as the risk is increasing.
Ambuja cement is highly volatile as it can be seen that there is 80%  of its weightage in high risk profile and decreasing to 9% in low risk profile.

# Analyzing the graphs

In low risk profile almost straight line graph is formed. There are very less fluctuations in graph giving low returns as compared to moderate and high risk profiles. The graph is very stable as it should be because it is taking stocks at low risk and hence giving low returns.
In moderate risk profile more fluctuations are seen as compared to low risk profile giving more returns than low risk profile. Generally people prefer moderate risk profiles. 
In high risk profile there are lot of fluctuations due to high volatility and giving much more returns than the other two profiles.

# Market Conditions during past 5 Years

I am taking data of past 5 years and in past 5 years all the stocks were stable but Ambuja cement was volatile but it is increasing from last 5 years.
Last 5 years also contain data of covid years in which all of the above stocks experienced volatility and half of the companies got negatively impacted.
